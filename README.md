# Pull Request

when creating a pull request, you need to inform us of what you have done or changed.for example, if Adewale wants to create a pull request to submit a solution for version control topic.it would go thus:
 -  I Added a versioncontrol.txt file that contains solution to the version control task.
 -  I corrected the solution to the last task in lasttask.txt.


# Keeping your Fork in Sync

As more content is added to this repository and more people contribute, your fork will fall out of date. This can sometimes lead to tricky situations with your pull requests. It's recommended to occasionally [sync your fork](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/) with this repository.
